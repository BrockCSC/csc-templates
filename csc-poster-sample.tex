%% BODY
% The body of the poster goes here. Splitting it into paragrahs is suggested.
In addition to word of mouth and email, the CSC uses posters to help spread the
news on CSC events. The Information Officer and Event Planner can work together
or individually to create these. It's a good idea to have our President
finalize the poster you're working on. Once approved, it can be hung on the
CSC's door for passersby to see.

Posters can be made for all sorts of ``events'', be it academic or social
gatherings.

Attend this fake talk to discover the benefits of using posters.
