\section*{Membership:}

Membership in the Computer Science Club is open to anyone willing to join,
though voting membership is only open to undergraduate computer science students at
Brock University. Membership costs \$5 per school year and may be paid in advance.\\
\\
What does membership get you? Here's the quick summary: your fee supports club events that are
open to all and grants you access to club services such as our computing \& gaming environment,
discounted prices on snacks \& drinks, and our library \& digital library.
It also makes you eligible for volunteer positions in the club,
if you'd prefer to do more than just pay to support our activities.

\section*{Events:} 

Each term, the CSC runs numerous academic and social events.
These events range from socials, the most infamous being the nerdcrawl;
through tutorials and workshops, including an introduction to the CS student's best
friend: the UNIX environment; to talks from professors and Computer Science
luminaries. Some past talks include: \emph{Google AI Competition},
\emph{Intro to Genetic Algorithms}, and \emph{How a Search Engine Works}.
Some past tutorials include: \emph{How To Crimp Cable} and \emph{Installing Linux}.

\section*{Services:}

The Computer Science Club provides several services to its members, including
a computing environment, a telivision and gaming consoles
for your entertainment, a library of literature, and an office to use it all in.

\subsection*{Computing Environment:}

Our primary machine is used for club operations, school work, and gaming.
Academic use gets highest priority. It runs Windows and Linux.
We also have a server which you can reach at \emph{brockbots.cosc.brocku.ca}.

\subsection*{Entertainment Station:}

We offer a gaming station that's just like home; a comfy couch and huge TV.
Our collection ranges from classic consoles to current-gen consoles.\\
\\
A few of our members kindly donate or lend us their games or gaming systems. If you would
like to bring in anything, feel free to do so but notify an executive.

\subsection*{Library:}

The CSC maintains an extensive collection of Computer Science related 
books. The library can (soon) be browsed online by going to the library section of our
website, or in person in the office. CSC members are free to borrow most of 
the books in the library, with the exception of certain signed copies and
course textbooks.

\subsection*{Office:}

The CS Club office can be found in MC J330. It houses a library, a great
place to socialize with other members, a fridge, games, and of
course a computer. It is open mostly between 9:00 and 21:00 during weekdays
and populated by helpful and friendly office staff.

\section*{Volunteer:}

If you would like to get involved with the club there are various ways to
volunteer your time, beyond running for an executive position. If you'd like
to sign up, the info below will tell you who to email, or you can just ask
in person at our office.

\subsection*{Program Committee}

Headed by the Vice President, the Program Committee organizes club events and
meetings, works with speakers and presenters to make sure they're happy, gets
the venues and equipment ready, and does everything else involved in running talks.
If you'd like to get involved contact us at csc@cosc.brocku.ca or talk to an executive.

\subsection*{Systems Committee}

If systems administration is more your passion, and you would like to help run
the CSC's systems contact the Systems Administrator at
csc@cosc.brocku.ca and join the Systems Committee. The volunteers
help keep our computing environment up, under the Administrator's
direction.

\subsection*{Others}

In addition to our two large committees there are several other ways to be
involved, talk to the executive about one of the appointed positions:
librarian, office manager, webmaster, or ask the office manager about joining
the office staff. In addition to these named positions we can always use a
helping hand, so email csc@cosc.brocku.ca and tell us what you can do.
