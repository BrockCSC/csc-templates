\cscsubtitle{How To Crimp Your Own Network Cable}

Tired of buying overpriced ethernet cables and still not having the right length? You're in luck! Join us this Friday evening to learn how to prepare Cat5 networking cable. We provide you with a sample cable, the tools, and an instructor! Finally you can have those LANs you've always been dreaming about.\\

This is a \textbf{FREE} event and is restricted to CSC members (registration forms will be available). The CSC will be open for snacks and drinks and will also be selling cable at an affordable price.
