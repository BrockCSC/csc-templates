\cscsubtitle{Free Pizza Lunch}

The annual \emph{Meet the Profs Pizza Lunch} is a great chance for students to meet their professors and get to know them personally --- one of the advantages of a small CS department.
This is also a great opportunity for new students to meet returning computer science students!\\

Pizza will be \textbf{FREE} for computer science club members and the department staff. Everyone else will have to pay \$8 to join in on the lunch \emph{OR} you can pay \$5 to become a CSC member and get lunch for free, you do the math.
