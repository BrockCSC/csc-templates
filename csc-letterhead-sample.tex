\opening{Dear Denis Dyack:} % Sample letter

On behalf of the Computer Science Club (CSC), I would like to extend a formal invitation; 
we would like you to be a guest speaker at the upcoming Video Game Seminar held by the CSC. 
The theme of this seminar is "Intro to Xbox 360 games: Joing the XNA Creators Club."
The seminar will be held at Brock University, MC J301, in the Computer Science Department, on December 5, 2010. 

For your information, I will be leading the seminar.
I will forward a complete draft of the program to you in a few weeks so that you can know what specific subjects
will be covered by the other speakers.

We expect attendance this year to be higher than it has ever been â€“ approximately 30 students and 3 speakers.
We would be pleased and honoured if you would be our closing speaker at the seminar. 

Thank you very much for your time and attention, I do enjoy your work.

\closing{Yours sincerely,}

% Optional postscripts.
\ps{P.S. Too Human was great.}
\ps{P.P.S. No really.}
